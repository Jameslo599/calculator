Functionality

Calculator contains functions for all basic math operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide and power) typically found on a simple calculator. 

When pressing an operator button, the calculator evaluates no more than a single pair of numbers at a time. If you enter a number followed by an operator and another number, that calculation is displayed if your next input is an operator.

Users are able to string together several operations and receive the correct answer.

The "c" button will completely wipe out any existing data, allowing the user to start anew. There is also a backspace button to correct accidental inputs.

The user is able to input decimals and change the sign of the integer. Resulting values with long decimals are automatically rounded to the seventh decimal place.

Keyboard support is available for all buttons except the "+/-" button.

This project is a demonstration of my ability to combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a clean, cohesive application. Overall, I thought the project was straightforward to program, but I had to spend some time to make sure negative numbers operated correctly in calculations. There was also the challenge of having the default "0" display work with additional inputs as the 0 would disappear after pressing any button.

I spent some time getting more familiar with various html inputs and figuring out which DOM events seemed to work best for different input types.

I also spent time further practicing webkit transitions and taking time to make sure the colors had aesthetically pleasing transparency and combinations.
